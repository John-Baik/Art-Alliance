# Art-Alliance

A full stack web application for employers who want to find freelancers for hire.

As someone who dabbled in both freelance work and hiring other creatives, I always thought it would be nice to have an app to find and hire talent in a simple social media style format. I also have a lot of friends who do freelance for a living so I thought something like this would be ideal for them to find work.
